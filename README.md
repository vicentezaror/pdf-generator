# PDF Generator
Headless (backend-side) pdf generator build for Node, relying on [Puppeteers](https://www.npmjs.com/package/puppeteer) and [Mustache](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mustache) to generate PDFs from HTML templates.

_* As this is a headless package it can be also used on frontend_

This package receives input data in `JSON` format, then generates and returns a PDF file Buffer.
